Featuring wavy synths and muted melodic vocals reminiscent of cloud rap influences like
Blackbear or Lil Peep, the debut single "Wither" is a dark but intimate affair with introspective and vulnerable
lyrics about searching for something long lost, a romance already extinguished. 
<br><br>
Venturing into
a serious topic, BVDBATCH elaborates that the project veers into his complex sense of
personhood, love and intimate relationships; mirroring the demons that suppress his inner
desire for fulfilment, belonging and autonomy. 
<br><br>
Itâ€™s a glowing slice of dark dream pop, complete
with its emo/metal roots to keep the project facing firmly towards the future, and angsty visuals
for an emotive lo-fi bedroom pop vibe.
